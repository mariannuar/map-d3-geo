# Building a Map Component using the module d3-geo from the D3.js library

This repository shows and explains though a simple example of how to build a map in a site using some modules from the D3.js library that is used for Data Visualizations.

## What is D3.js

It's a Javascript library created by Mike Bostock that is used to visualize complex data with Web Standards. This means, D3 uses existing standards such HTML, CSS and SVG to visualize this data.

D3 has modules to visualize data in different ways, in this example we are using the D3 Geo module, that is used to represent maps as svg (or canvas).

## Working with this project.

To work with this project, first you'll need to have a version of `Node >= 14`. Then run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.

To run the project just use this command `npm run start`.

This will open you a window in your browser, that will display the following map:

## Using and explaning the project and how to use the d3 module to build maps.

### D3 geo
As it was mentioned before, we are using the d3-geo module. To use it in any project, you just have to install it.

If you are using npm, run `npm install d3-geo`, or if you are using yarn, run `yarn add d3-geo`.

Then, you will have to import it in your js file:

```
  import { geoAlbersUsa, geoPath } from "d3-geo";
```

The `geoPath` is a geographic path generator, similar to the shape generators in [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape): it generates an SVG path data by giving a GeoJSON geometry or feature object. 

This creates a new geographic path generator with the default settings. You can specified the projection, so this sets the current projection to the specified projection you want. If there isn't a projection specified, it will use the current one which for default returns null. It represents the identity transformation: the input geometry is not projected and is instead rendered directly in raw coordinates.

That's why we imported the `geoPath` because for this example we want to use the `geoAlbersUsa` as the projection.


Projections transform spherical polygonal geometry to planar polygonal geometry. D3 provides implementations of several classes of standard projections:

- [Azimuthal Projections](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#azimuthal-projections)
- [Composite Projections](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#composite-projections)
- [Conic Projections](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#conic-projections)
- [Cylindrical Projections](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#cylindrical-projections)

For this example, we are using `Composite Projections`, which consist in several projections into a single display. It has fixed clip, center and rotation, so this means, it doesn't suppor projection.clipAngle, projection.clipExtend, projection.rotate and projection.center. 

That's why we imported the [geoAlbersUsa](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#geoAlbersUsa), which is a combination of three [d3.geoConicEqualArea](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#geoConicEqualArea). In this projection, for the lower forty eight states it uses the `d3.geoAlbers` and for Alaska and Hawai it uses separate conic equal-area.

In the code, we define a variable for the projection and the path. In the following way we define the `geoAlberUsa` as the projection of our map:

```
const projection = geoAlbersUsa();

const path = geoPath().projection(projection);
```

### D3 fetch
Now, we will need another module from `D3 js` besides the `d3-geo`, and that's [d3-fetch](https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch). This module allows us to fetch data from any kind of file. This module has built-in support for parsing JSON, CSV, and TSV.

To install it, if you are using npm you have to run `npm install d3-fetch`, and if you are using yarn, `yarn add d3-fetch`.

To use it for this example, we do it in the following way

```
const geojsonApiUrl = json(`../static/states-10m.json`);
```

The `states-10m.json` is a TopoJSON file that includes the coordinates of our States Map. This file is important because it will tell to d3 all the data needed to build the map. [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) is an extension of GeoJSON that encodes topology. Rather than representing geometries discretely, geometries in TopoJSON files are stitched together from shared line segments called arcs. The use of this in this example will be explain a little bit more below.

### D3 Selection
This is another module from `D3 js` that we will need, and that is [d3-selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection). This module allows us to set attributes, styles, properties, HTML or text content, and more. Using the data joinâ€™s enter and exit selections, you can also add or remove elements to correspond to data.

To install it, if you are using npm you have to run `npm install d3-selection`, and if you are using yarn, `yarn add d3-selection`.

Then, you will have to import it in your js file, in the following way:

```
import { selection } from d3-selection;
```

In our example, the selection method will return the selection of the element with the id `map-wrapper`, so this allows us to append an `svg` element with a `viewBox` attribute, where the map will be printed.

```
const svg = select("#map-wrapper")
  .append("svg")
  .attr("viewBox", `0 0 ${width} ${height}`);
```

### Topojson Client
This is the last module that we will need, the [topojson-client](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-client). It allows us to manipulates our TopoJSON file through the tools it provides.

To install it, if you are using npm you have to run `npm install topojson-client`, and if you are using yarn, `yarn add topojson-client`.

Then, you will have to import it in your js file, in the following way:

```
import { feature } from "topojson-client";
```

For this example, we show the data for the number of Taylor Swift concerts in each state over the last 13 years. However, there are some states that has never had a concert of Taylor Swift, so we will need a json file with the postal codes of the states that have ever had at least one concert of her, and that would be the `states-with-taylor-swift-concerts.json`, with this we can add color to each state to difference the number of concerts according to the color. 

Also, we will need a json file of the postal codes `state-codes.json` because our TopoJSON file, returns an id of each state, and our `states-with-taylor-swift-concerts.json` includes the postal code of the state, so to match both in the map, we need that file that has the `postal code` and the value of the `id` that is coming from the TopoJSON file.

Now, to explain the use of everything together so we build and print our map, we will just need this piece of code:

```
svg
  .selectAll(".map__state")
  .data(feature(geojson, geojson.objects.states).features)
  .enter()
  .filter((d) => postalCodes.find((state) => state.val === d.id))
  .append("g")
  .attr("class", (d) => hasTaylorSwiftConcerts(d.id))
  .attr("id", (d) => `state-${d.id}`)
  .insert("path")
  .attr("d", path);
```

Remember the `svg` we created before? To that `svg` we will set the data from the TopoJSON file, classes, id, insert elements, and other things to all `map__state` elements in the current document.

First, we will use the property `data` from d3, which defines the array that's being `enter` to the svg. In this data we are returning the GeoJS0N Feature or FeatureCollection for the specified object in the given topology by using the tool `feature` from `topojson-client`. If the specified object is a string, it is treated as topology.objects[object]. Then, if the object is a GeometryCollection, a FeatureCollection is returned, and each geometry in the collection is mapped to a Feature. Otherwise, a Feature is returned. So for this example we are returning. So in our case, it will return the `geojson.objects.states` from our TopoJSON file, which means identifiers, bounding boxes, properties and coordinates of each state.

Second, we use the `filter` attribute to match each feature `id` with the `postal code` value of our `state-codes.json` file. Then we append a `g` to svg for each feature, which will have a `class` attribute for adding a color class to add styles, so each state is differentiated by this class, and a `id` attribute, all of this by using the property `attr`. 

Finaly, through the `insert` attribute, we insert a `path` to each `g` and this one will have the `d` attribute that defines the path to be drawn, in this case will be the projection we explained before, taking in count the coordinates, identifiers, bounding boxes, properties and coordinates of each state to match everything and print the map.
